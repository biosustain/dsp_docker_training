# Docker Introduction

What if reviewer number 2 tells you that it is impossible to reproduce your results? Ups! Figuring out all software versions and dependencies in your machine and in the reviewer's machine and compare them sounds like very tedious work! Wouldn't it be nice to send him/her your pipeline in a Docker container with the needed software pre-installed and all the dependencies in place?

Docker simplifies bioinformatics workflows by ensuring reproducibility, portability, and dependency management, which makes it essential in computational biology.

And remember to ask questions during the Data Club or over lunch, you can always contact us at [Data Science platform email](mailto:datascience@biosustain.dtu.dk).
