# Docker Introduction

Docker is a handy management tool to build, run and share container images.

Differences between a container and a container image?

Docker is widely used in bioinformatics because it addresses several challenges that are common in this field:

- Reproducibility
- Portability
- Sofware dependency management
- Scalability
- Collaboration
- Version control of environments
- Integration with other bioinformatics tools (e.g. Nextflow)

When you install Docker Desktop (is it mandatory, worth),... where are the images saved, are they occupying a lot? Things to take into account in the maintenance ...

These container images can be uploaded and published in a centralized repository known as [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), or hosted by other parties, such as [Quay](https://quay.io/).
