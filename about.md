## Data Science platform

Data Science has become an essential piece both in academia and industry to accelerate gaining insights into the generated datasets. As a strategy to integrate high-level analytics in [DTU - Biosustain](https://www.biosustain.dtu.dk/) we created a centralized [Data Science platform (DSP)](https://www.biosustain.dtu.dk/technologies/informatics/data-science-platform) that provides support to our researchers while promoting standardized data and data processes.

The DSP team aims to make data science more accessible and inclusive not only at DTU Biosustain but also across the DTU Community. The platform follows a data-centric approach that focuses on data infrastructure, processes, and outputs as ongoing, evolving products rather than one-time projects. Each data product is designed as a multidisciplinary collaboration involving the entire data lifecycle and pursuing standardization and automation, and with data usage and reusage in mind. 

The DSP is based on four pillars: 

– Support: our research fellows on Statistics, Programming, Data analytics, and Machine learning

– Education: coorganizing Data club with DTU - Bioengineering and organizing Data Science workshops

– Innovation: introducing researchers to new computational biology methods and technologies  

– Tooling: implementing open-sourced standard tools
